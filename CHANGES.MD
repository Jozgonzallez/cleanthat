## [Unreleased]
### Changes
* CleanThat Robot will open a single Review-Request per protected-branch (instead of opening one for each dirty event, with a random). The naming convention is `cleanthat/headfor-XXX-yyyy-MM-dd` where `XXX` is the protected branch name and `yyyy-MM-dd` is current day.
* Fixes ImportOrderStep when the ordersFile parameters is used.
* Handle any source JDK version (with the help of [JavaVersion](https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-languages/blob/master/plexus-java/src/main/java/org/codehaus/plexus/languages/java/version/JavaVersion.java))
* Additional mutator: `LocalVariableTypeInference` turns `int i = 10;` into `var i = 10;`
